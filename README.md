**Title CodTech IT Solutions Internship - Task Documentation: Chatbot in Java**

**Introduction**

This documrntation provides a detailed explanation of the task assigned during the CodTech IT solutions Internship program.
This Java program implements a chatbot that engages in conversation with users, responding to various queries and interactions.
The chatbot is designed to understand natural language input and provide appropriate responses based on predefined conditions. 
It operates in a loop, continuously prompting the user for input and generating responses accordingly. 
The program utilizes basic Java syntax and constructs such as loops, conditional statements, and method calls to achieve it's functionality.

**Task Description :**
the task assigned to Venkatesh Chedu during the codtech IT solutions Internship program is to write a java program the create a Chatbot.

**Implementation**
the implementation of the task involves utilizing java programming language to create a simple program that iterates from chatbot. 
The program "while" loop to achieve this functionality efficiently.Below is the code implementation:

**java**

package CodTech;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ChatBot {

	
 public static void main(String[] args) {
		
	Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
	System.out.println("Hello! I'm a simple chatbot.how i can help you today!");
		
	while (true) {
     	  System.out.print("User: ");
	  String userInput = scanner.nextLine().toLowerCase(); 
			
	  if (userInput.equals("bye"))
	  {
		System.out.println("Chatbot: Goodbye! Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions in the future. Have a great day!");
		break;
	  }
			
		String botResponse = getBotResponse(userInput);
		System.out.println("Chatbot: " + botResponse);
	  }
		
	      scanner.close();
		
	}

    public static String getBotResponse(String userInput) {
        String botResponse = "";
        
        if (userInput.contains("hello") || userInput.contains("hi")) {
            botResponse = "Hi there!How can I assist you today?";
        } else if (userInput.contains("how are you")) {
            botResponse = "I'm just a chatbot,but thanks for asking!";
        } else if (userInput.contains("time")) {
            botResponse = "Sorry,I don't have access to real-time data such as the current time.";
        } else {
            botResponse = "I'm not sure how to respond to that. Can you ask another question?";
        }
        
        return botResponse;
    }
}


**Introduction**
Welcome to the documentation for the Java Chatbot project. This document aims to provide comprehensive guidance on understanding, setting up, and utilizing the Java Chatbot application. The Chatbot is designed to engage in conversation with users, understand natural language input, and respond appropriately using predefined responses.

**System Architecture**
The Java Chatbot application consists of a single main class (ChatBot) that handles user input and response generation. The architecture is straightforward, with a loop continuously accepting user input until the user decides to exit the conversation.
Java Chatbot Implementation

1.ChatBot Class:
This class represents the chatbot functionality and contains the main method for running the chatbot program.

2.main Method:
The main method serves as the entry point of the program.
It initializes a Scanner object to read user input from the console.
Prints a welcome message to greet the user.

3.User Interaction Loop:
The program enters an infinite loop using while (true) to continuously interact with the user until the user inputs "bye" to exit the chatbot.
Inside the loop, it prompts the user to input a message and reads the input using scanner.nextLine().
Converts the user input to lowercase using toLowerCase() to make the chatbot case-insensitive.

4.Handling User Input:
Checks if the user input is "bye". If so, the chatbot prints a goodbye message and breaks out of the loop, terminating the program.
Otherwise, it calls the getBotResponse method to generate a response based on the user input.

5.getBotResponse Method:
This method takes the user input as a parameter and returns a response from the chatbot.
It determines the appropriate response based on the content of the user input using conditional statements (if-else).
If the user input contains greetings like "hello" or "hi", the chatbot responds with a greeting message.
If the user asks "how are you", the chatbot responds with a predefined message acknowledging that it's just a chatbot.
If the user mentions "time", the chatbot responds that it doesn't have access to real-time data.
If none of the predefined conditions match, the chatbot responds with a default message asking the user to ask another question.

6.Closing Resources:
Finally, the Scanner object is closed to release system resources after the interaction loop is terminated.**Introduction**

**Setup Instructions**
To set up and run the Java Chatbot application, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
Download the Java Chatbot source code.
Compile the source code using a Java compiler.
Run the compiled program.

**User Guide**
The Java ChatBot is simple to use. Just follow these guidelines:

Upon running the application, the Chatbot greets the user and awaits input.
Type your message in the console and press Enter.
The Chatbot processes your input and generates a response.
Continue the conversation or type "bye" to end the conversation.

**Code Explanation**
The main components of the Java Chatbot code (ChatBot.java) are explained as follows:

Main Method: Handles user input and response generation within a loop.
generateResponse Method: Determines the appropriate response based on the user input using a switch statement.

**Testing Documentation**
The Java Chatbot has undergone testing to ensure its functionality and reliability. Various test cases were used to evaluate its performance, including valid input, invalid input, and edge cases.

**Future Enhancements**
Potential future enhancements for the Java Chatbot include integrating advanced natural language processing techniques, expanding the response database, and adding features such as voice recognition.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, the Java Chatbot project provides a simple yet effective way to engage in conversation using natural language input. With further development and enhancements, it has the potential to become a more sophisticated and intelligent conversational agent.
